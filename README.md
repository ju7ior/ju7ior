Full Stack Software Developer currently working towards a Bachelor's of Computer Science at the University of Central Florida.
Passionate about developing software that is maximalist in it's scope and functionality yet appears and feels minimalist to the end user.

Lover of all kinds of art, particularly furniture design, architecture and film ( [Pinterest](https://pin.it/7qNHkN3) for inspiration). Always looking for better, and/or different, ways to look at the world around me and it's problems, through curiosity, patience, philosophy and science.
